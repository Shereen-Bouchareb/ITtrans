 resolve:

Called when the asynchronous operation completes successfully.
In this case, it is called after successfully inserting a port into the ports table.
resolve() transitions the promise from the "pending" state to the "fulfilled" state.


reject:

Called when the asynchronous operation fails or encounters an error.
In this case, it is called if there is an error during the insertion into the ports table.
reject(err) transitions the promise from the "pending" state to the "rejected" state and passes the error as the reason for rejection.
